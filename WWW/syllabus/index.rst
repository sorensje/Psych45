**Head TA**: Karen LaRocque

**Alternate Exams TA**: Ellie Chestnut

----------------

Course Requirements
--------------------------------------------

The course grade will be based on two midterms (each 25%), a cumulative final (35%), and a written assignment
(15%). **For the written assignment, students are asked to submit a 4-page (double-spaced) paper that
summarizes and critiques the accuracy of how memory is depicted in the movie Memento.** Guidelines for
the written assignment can be found below.


.. note:: Attending lectures is important because much of the material will be presented only in lectures. That is, lectures will not simply present the material from the text and readings in lecture format, but rather will focus on discussing complementary material.

Written Assignment: Memory in *Memento*
--------------------------------------------

**Due May 28, 2015, immediately after class**

For the written assignment, students are asked to submit a 4-page (double-spaced) paper that
summarizes and critiques the accuracy of how memory is depicted in the movie Memento. The objective of
the written assignment is to provide an opportunity for you to think actively and independently about the nature of
memory, as revealed through experimental research. Your assignment is to serve as a *memory expert* who has
been called upon to review the movie *Memento* (2000). Your task is to write a review of the movie that highlights
three characteristics of memory that are explicitly depicted in the film (Note: The movie depicts many more than
three characteristics of memory; you should choose the three that you would like to write about).

Importantly, for each of the three characteristics you discuss, you should:

- (i) describe the form of memory, the memory process, or the characteristic of memory that is depicted;

- (ii) critically evaluate whether the depiction is accurate or inaccurate, stating exactly what the director got right or wrong;

- (iii) provide experimental evidence from the literature discussed in class and/or in the readings that supports your evaluation.

The instructor and TAs will organize two opportunities to screen *Memento* (see dates on Schedule, below). If you cannot
attend either screening, then you should make arrangements to independently view the film. Stanford library has
three copies of the DVD that can be checked out, and the movie is also available on iTunes and GooglePlay.

.. note:: Late policy: Points will be taken off for late papers unless there is a medical emergency, in fairness to those who submit in a timely manner. Serious health or other issues that interfere with exam and assignment dates can be discussed with the Alternate Exams TA (Ellie Chestnut).

Optional Opportunities
--------------------------------------------

Learning and Memory Cafes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wagner, LaRocque, and one additional TA will host 5 Learning and Memory
Cafes (LMCs). The LMCs will provide up to 15 students per meeting the opportunity to discuss topics of
interest in learning and memory. At each LMC, attendees are invited to bring their questions,
observations, and general thoughts about learning and memory to the group. We will be there with coffee,
tea, and snacks, along with a willingness to engage with your topics of interest. 

The dates for the LMCs are below.

Memory at the Movies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will offer two supplemental Memory at the Movies events, during which we will
hold screenings of *Roshomon* and *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*. We will provide popcorn and
we will host a post-screening discussion of the memory-related issues raised in these movies.

Be the DJ
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Humans reflect on learning and memory in multiple forms of artist expression, from movies, to
books, to visual arts, to music. Drawing from the latter, just prior to each lecture we will play music that is
thematically related to the day’s topic. We are inviting you to be the DJ. Via Piazza, we welcome
suggestions for songs to play. Suggestions should arrive 48 hrs prior to the targeted lecture so as to
provide us an opportunity to pick the songs. We look forward to your input!
